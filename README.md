## Repository

This repository contains my Nand to Tetris project solutions. The course is comprised of two parts, hardware and software. Each part contains six projects that are self-contained in accordance with the abstraction principle.

## References

The course is based upon [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/) by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. Also the official course [website](https://www.nand2tetris.org) contains all the project materials and software tools needed.
