Project solutions for the Nand to Tetris course.

## Course

The best way to understand how a computer works is to built one from scratch. And that is exactly what [Nand to Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org) does. The course leads students through 12 projects that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy. Throughout the processes students gain invaluable hands-on knowledge in the following areas:

- Hardware architecture,
- Operating systems,
- Programming languages,
- Compilers,
- Data structures,
- Algorithms, and
- Software engineering.

It's a fantastic course and I highly recommend it.

## Repository

This repository contains my Nand to Tetris project solutions. The course is comprised of two parts, hardware and software. Each part contains six projects that are self-contained in accordance with the abstraction principle.

## Project solutions

### Part I: The hardware

First part is dedicated to the design and implementation of a computer hardware named `Hack`. The repository contains [hardware solutions](https://github.com/itopaloglu83/Nand-to-Tetris/tree/master/Hardware) to the following projects.

- Project 01: Boolean Logic
- Project 02: Boolean Arithmetic
- Project 03: Sequential Logic
- Project 04: Machine Language
- Project 05: Computer Architecture
- Project 06: Assembler

### Part II: The software

Second part starts with the virtual machine design, implements a high level object oriented language called `Jack`, and ends with compiler and the operating system. The repository contains [software solutions](https://github.com/itopaloglu83/Nand-to-Tetris/tree/master/Software) to the following projects.

- Project 07: Virtual Machine, Stack Arithmetic
- Project 08: Virtual Machine, Program Control
- Project 09: High-Level Language
- Project 10: Compiler, Syntax Analysis
- Project 11: Compiler, Code Generation
- Project 12: Operating System
