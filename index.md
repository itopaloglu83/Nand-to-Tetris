# Nand to Tetris
{: .no_toc }

## Course

The best way to understand how a computer works is to built one from scratch. And that is exactly what [Nand to Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org) does. The course leads students through 12 projects that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy. Throughout the processes students gain invaluable hands-on knowledge in the following areas:

- Hardware architecture,
- Operating systems,
- Programming languages,
- Compilers,
- Data structures,
- Algorithms, and
- Software engineering.

It's a fantastic course and I highly recommend it.

## Repository

This repository contains my Nand to Tetris project solutions. The course is comprised of two parts, hardware and software. Each part contains six projects that are self-contained in accordance with the abstraction principle.

### Part I: The hardware
Project 1 through 6.

### Part II: The software
Project 7 through 12.

## References

The course is based upon [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/) by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. Also the official course [website](https://www.nand2tetris.org) contains all the project materials and software tools needed.
